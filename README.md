## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of our research paper:
> "A Novel Explainable AI Framework for Medical Image Classification Integrating Statistical, Visual, and Rule-Based Methods"

We propose a novel eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework that enhances interpretability in medical image classification by integrating Statistical Features, Visual Explanations and Rule-Based Explanations.

Novel XAI for medical images using statistical, visual, and rule-based methods.
• Overlaying statistical measures on feature maps for localized, quantifiable insights.
• Decision trees and RuleFit extract human-readable rules explaining model decisions.
• Evaluation on medical datasets validated by radiologists for clinical relevance.

## Key Features
- Uses a custom MobileNetV2 model for feature extraction.
- Integrates zero-based filtering with mutual importance selection for feature refinement.
- Extracts explainable rules using Decision Trees and RuleFit.
- Generates statistical overlays on feature maps for localized insights.
- Evaluated on five diverse medical imaging datasets, validated by radiologists.
